#  Gemini-Powered Customer Support Agent (GenAI Capstone)

This project is a working MVP of a GenAI customer support agent — built using Gemini, function calling, document retrieval, and structured output.

It was created as part of the **Kaggle x Google GenAI Capstone (2025)**.

##  What It Can Do

The agent:
- Classifies incoming support messages using Gemini (zero-shot)
- Detects urgency (priority) with hybrid logic
- Retrieves relevant KB documents via RAG (embeddings + cosine similarity)
- Calls live functions to access invoice/order/payment data
- Controls tone based on the message category
- Simulates short-term memory using previous messages
- Evaluates its own responses (scoring + feedback)
- Logs all interactions to a CSV (MLOps-style)
